# Red Wine Quality
An analysis of factors which determine the perceived quality of red wine.

The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning theory to see if it is possible to build a reliable model for predicting wine quality. This will be my first project which involves the application of supervised machine learning and will incorporate some basic tuning of the models. 

The project idea was chosen as I believed wine quality to be a relatively predictable and commonplace feature which likely has patterns across particular variables, e.g. acidity or alcohol percentage. The data used 11 independent variables across 1599 samples. Wines were given a ranking of 4-8. Given the discrete nature of the dependent variables, the three machine learning models to be explored shall be K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees & Random Forests.

The project has been broken down into three portions: Analysis of the effect of each independent variables upon the dependent variables, Analysis of collinearity among independent variables, and Application of machine learning theory by building several supervised models.
